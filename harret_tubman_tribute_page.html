						<li><strong>1819</strong> - Araminta Ross [Harriet Tubman] was born into slavery in 1819 or 1820, in Dorchester County, Maryland. Given the names of her two parents, both held in slavery, she was of purely African ancestry.</li>
						<li><strong>1844</strong> - In 1844 at the age of 25, she married John Tubman, a free African American who did not share her dream. She wanted to excape up north, but her husband John told her that if she ran off, he would tell her master.</li>
						<li><strong>1849</strong> - In 1984 Harriet left her Husband John, and planned her escape. Her white abolitionist neighbor helped plan the escape.</li>
						<li><strong>1849-1950</strong> - Harriet met William Still, a freeborn black man that could read and write. With the assistance of Still, and other members of the Philadelphia Anti-Slavery Society, she learned about the workings of the Underground Railroad.</li>
						<li><strong>1950</strong> - In September of the same year, Harriet was made an official "conductor" of the UGRR. This meant that she knew all the routes to free territory and she had to take an oath of silence so the secret of the Underground Railroad would be kept secret.</li>
