						<li><strong>1822*</strong> - Tubman was born <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harriet_Tubman">Araminta "Minty" Ross</a> to slave parents, Harriet ("Rit") Green and Ben Ross on a plantation near Blackwater River in Madison, Maryland. As with many slaves in the United States, neither the exact year nor place of Araminta's birth is known, and historians differ as to the best estimate.</li>
						<li><strong>1834</strong> - At the age of 25, she married John Tubman, a free African American who did not share her dream. She wanted to excape up north, but her husband, John told her that if she ran off, he would tell her master.</li>
						<li><strong>1849</strong> - Harriet left her Husband John, and planned her escape. Her white abolitionist neighbor helped plan the escape.</li>
						<li><strong>1849-1950</strong> - Harriet met <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Still">William Still</a>, a freeborn black man that could read and write. With the assistance of Still, and other members of the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Anti-Slavery_Society">Philadelphia Anti-Slavery Society</a>, she learned about the workings of the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underground_Railroad">Underground Railroad.</a></li>
						<li><strong>1850</strong> - In September of the same year, Harriet was made an official "conductor" of the UGRR. This meant that she knew all the routes to free territory and she had to take an oath of silence so the secret of the Underground Railroad would be kept secret.</li>
						<li><strong>1850</strong> - <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugitive_Slave_Act_of_1850">The Fugitive Slave Act</a> was passed. It stipulated that it was illegal for any citizen to assist an escaped slave and demanded that if an escaped slave was sighted, he or she should be apprehended and turned in to the authorities for deportation back to the "rightful" owner down south. Escaping slaves were now being sent into Canada instead of the "North" of the U.S. </li>
						<li><strong>1851</strong> - Harriet made her third trip, this time to she went to get her husband, John, but he had remarried and did not want to leave. So she went back up North, but not before stopping at Garret's house to rescue some more runaways. The trip was long and cold but they did reach the safe house of <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Douglass">Frederick Douglas.</a></li>
						<li><strong>1852</strong> - Tubman was ready to return to the U.S. to help free more slaves. In the spring, she worked in Cape May and saved enough money to go to Maryland. By now, Tubman had led so many people from the South - the slave's called this the "land of Egypt" - to freedom, she became known as "Moses." She was also known by the plantation owners for her efforts and a bounty of $40,000 was posted.</li>
						<li><strong>1852-1857</strong> - Tubman made eleven trips from Maryland to Canada from 1852-1857. Her most famous trip concerned a passenger who panicked and wanted to turn back. Tubman was afraid if he left he would be tortured and would tell all he knew about the Railroad. The unwilling passenger changed his mind when Tubman pointed a gun at his head and said "dead folks tell no tales."</li>
